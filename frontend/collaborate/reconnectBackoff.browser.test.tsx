/**
 * A render is not a reason to open a socket.
 *
 * The session view re-renders constantly -- a remote cursor, a chat line, a
 * catch-up counter -- and the callbacks the WebSocket hook closes over are
 * rebuilt with it. When the effect that opens the connection depended on the
 * identity of those callbacks, every render called it again, and every path
 * that decides *not* to reconnect ends by setting connection state, which is
 * itself a render. So the decision not to reconnect scheduled the next
 * attempt: a session that was over answered 1008 to sixty-nine joins from one
 * client in eight seconds, and the backoff between attempts never ran once.
 *
 * Both halves are asserted here, because either alone leaves the loop
 * reachable: the connector the hook hands out must keep its identity, and a
 * refusal or a pending retry must survive the renders that follow it.
