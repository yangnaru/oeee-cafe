 * A join replays history; the canvas that comes out of it has to be the one
 * everybody else is looking at.
 *
 * This drives the real session view -- the real painter, the real drain, the
 * real decoder -- from the frames a server would send, because every part of
 * that path had tests and the failure lived between them. A room checkpoints
 * roughly every five hundred messages, so a full replay begins with somebody
 * else's snapshots and a RESET_POINT that arrives after them, and what those
 * two do to each other is not reachable from a test of either one.
 *
 * The shape is taken from a session that lost its canvas in production
 * (c9b8321d, 2026-08-20): four snapshots at the checkpoint sequence, a handful
 * of operations sequenced after the base while the upload was in flight, the
 * RESET_POINT, then ordinary drawing. The artwork is not -- these marks are
 * rectangles at known coordinates so a missing layer is an assertion rather
 * than something somebody has to notice.
