//! What a live collaborative canvas currently looks like, for the lobby.
//!
//! The server cannot draw. Room state is a log of NEO drawing operations plus
//! per-layer checkpoint snapshots, and turning that into a picture means the
//! engine in `neo-cucumber` -- a second implementation here would be a second
//! answer to "what does this stroke look like", which is the one divergence
//! this codebase cannot afford. So a participant's browser, which has the
//! canvas composited already, renders the preview and uploads it, exactly as
//! it already does for the finished drawing in `save_collaborative_session`.
//!
//! Which participant does the work is decided the way a checkpoint volunteer
//! is (see `RedisStateManager::claim_reset_upload`): whoever asks first inside
//! an open window gets a token, and the window is what paces the refresh. The
//! token comes back on the upload, so a client that claimed, went away, and
//! returned after its window closed cannot overwrite a newer preview with the
//! canvas it had a minute ago.
//!
//! The bytes are user-supplied and served to anyone who can see the session,
//! which is what separates this from the checkpoint path: a snapshot only ever
//! goes back to the room, whereas a preview goes into an `<img>` on a public
//! page. `inspect_image` is therefore not a formality -- it is the only thing
//! standing between a participant and a decompression bomb on the lobby.
