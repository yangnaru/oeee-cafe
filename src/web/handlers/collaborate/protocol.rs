//! What a client is allowed to send, and what the server does not take its
//! word for.
//!
//! Two jobs, both borrowed from Drawpile's server:
//!
//! - **The author is the server's to decide.** Every canvas message carries a
//!   1-byte session user id in its second byte, and that id is what says whose
//!   layers a mark lands on and whose undo stack it joins. A client that writes
//!   somebody else's id there paints on their canvas and undoes their work.
//!   Drawpile does not validate this field, it *overwrites* it
//!   (`client.cpp`, "Enforce origin ID, except when receiving a snapshot"),
//!   which costs one store and cannot be got around. So do we.
//!
//! - **A frame the server cannot parse does not enter history.** History is
//!   replayed to everyone who joins later, so a message accepted once is
//!   accepted forever. Drawpile treats an unparseable frame as a protocol
//!   violation and drops the connection (`Client::gotBadData`).
