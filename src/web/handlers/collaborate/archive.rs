//! An append-only recording of a room's canonical stream.
//!
//! The live history in `redis_messages` is a working set, not a record. A
//! checkpoint squashes everything at or below its base into snapshots and the
//! room's TTL takes the rest, which is exactly what keeps a busy room cheap --
//! and it is why a session that lost its drawing could only be examined
//! through whatever happened to survive in Redis an hour later.
//!
//! So this keeps the other copy: every message that was ever given a sequence
//! number, in the order it was given one, with the connection that sent it and
//! the moment it arrived. Nothing removes from it.
//!
//! Two things will read it. A replay of a finished collaboration is this log
//! applied from the beginning; a post-mortem of one that went wrong is the
//! same log read rather than rendered. Neither is built here -- this is the
//! recording, and it is the part that has to exist before either is possible,
//! because a log that was not kept cannot be added afterwards.
//!
//! ## What is and is not in it
//!
//! Everything that passes through `sequence_and_publish`, which is every
//! message that enters canonical history and the RESET_POINT that marks a
//! checkpoint. Not the checkpoint snapshots themselves: those are written
//! straight into history by the reset script, they run to megabytes, and a log
//! that starts at sequence 1 can render the same pixels from the operations.
//! `first_seq` in the manifest is what says whether a given archive does start
//! at 1 -- a session already under way when archiving was deployed does not,
//! and a reader has to be able to tell.
