# Optional: Override WebSocket URL for development/testing
# Useful when you need to connect to a different server or specific room
# Example: VITE_WS_URL=wss://example.com/api/collaborate/room-id/ws
# VITE_WS_URL=

# Development note:
# If VITE_WS_URL is not set, the app will automatically construct the WebSocket URL
# based on the current page location and extract the room ID from the URL path
