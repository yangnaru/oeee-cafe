/**
 * A PixelSurface over a plain RGBA buffer.
 *
 * Reproduces the canvas semantics the kernels lean on: reading outside the
 * bounds yields transparent pixels rather than throwing or wrapping, and
 * writing outside them is clipped. The returned sub-rectangle keeps the width
 * it was asked for, which matters -- blur walks its neighbours with
 * `index ± width * 4`, so a surface that quietly returned a narrower row would
 * blur against the wrong pixels.
 *
 * One thing it deliberately does *not* reproduce: a canvas stores pixels
 * premultiplied, so writing a translucent colour and reading it back loses a
 * little of it -- up to 12 of 255 at low alpha, converging to nothing as
 * strokes overlap and alpha climbs. A buffer keeps what it was given, and the
 * painter keeps that precision rather than throwing it away to match an
 * artefact. Playback therefore renders strokes very slightly differently from
 * the painter; the player applies the replay's restore frame when it reaches
 * the end so it still finishes on exactly the artwork.
