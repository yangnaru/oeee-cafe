/**
 * A press on a floating panel has to reach the control it landed on.
 *
 * Twice it did not. A drag across the panel selects its text if the panel
 * lets itself be selected, and while a selection is up the browser spends the
 * next press dismissing it -- so one stray drag on the toolbox left every
 * button after it dead, for good, since nothing in a panel of buttons clears
 * a selection.
 *
 * It did not, with a stylus. A pen and a finger are given to the browser's
 * gesture recognizer before they are given to the page, and on a surface that
 * has not refused it a press that slides a pixel or two is read as the start
 * of a scroll: the tap is cancelled and no `click` is ever fired. NEO's own
 * column never noticed -- every control in it acts on `pointerdown` -- but our
 * extras column and the buttons a host appends to it all act on `click`, so
 * for a tablet they simply stopped working partway through a drawing.
 *
 * `touch-action: none` is what refuses it, and the rule the browser applies is
 * the intersection down the ancestor chain: it is enough for the window to say
 * it, which is why the window is where it is said.
