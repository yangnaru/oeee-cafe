 * value here was read off a running NEO 1.7.0 rather than off its source, so
 * where the two disagreed the running instance won -- the column background is
 * `#ccccff`, not the `#ffffff` the generator had produced.

 *
 * The width is 50px where NEO's `#toolSet` is 52px, and that is deliberate.
 * NEO's widgets are 48px wide plus the 1px ring that box-shadow paints just
 * outside them, so they occupy 50px and leave 2px of slack in its column --
 * which NEO never shows, because it hangs the whole wrapper off the edge of
 * the painter (`#toolsWrapper { right: -3px }`). A floating panel has no edge
 * to hide slack behind, so keeping the raw 52px only produced a lopsided
 * panel: 3px of margin down one side and 7px down the other. The padding puts
 * the ring back inside, so every widget still sits exactly where NEO puts it.
