  /*
   * The whole window is something you press, never something you scroll.
   *
   * `touch-action` is why that has to be said out loud. A pen or a finger is
   * handled by the browser's gesture recognizer first, and on a surface that
   * has not refused it, a press that slides even slightly is taken for the
   * start of a scroll: the tap is cancelled, the button never paints its
   * pressed bevel, and -- the part that is actually fatal -- no `click` is
   * ever fired. NEO's own column survived that because every one of its
   * controls acts on `pointerdown`; our extras column, which acts on `click`
   * like the buttons a host appends to it, simply stopped responding to a
   * stylus, both in the painter and on the pages that embed it.
   *
   * So it is refused here, for the frame, rather than on each control that
   * remembers to -- the title bar and the zoom buttons each used to carry
   * their own copy, and the eight controls between them did not. A window
   * that can scroll keeps `pan-y`, since scrolling it is the one gesture it
   * does owe the browser.
   *
   * Selecting is refused for the same reason, and it is the half you can
   * reproduce on a desktop: these panels were made selectable, so a drag that
   * crosses the zoom readout and the theme label selects them both. A
   * selection is a mode, not an accident -- while one is up, the browser
   * spends the next press dismissing it, and on a touch screen it spends it
   * on the handles and the menu it has drawn as well. Every press after the
   * drag went there instead of to a button, which is the toolbox "stopping
   * working" partway through a drawing, and it stayed stopped because nothing
   * in a panel of buttons ever clears a selection. There is nothing in these
   * windows to read: they are buttons, a colour well and a list of names.
