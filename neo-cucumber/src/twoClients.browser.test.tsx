 * encoder that threw for one kind, a client that routed every kind but one, a
 * repaint that named the wrong participant. Each piece had tests; nothing ran
 * a mark from the hand that made it to the screen that had to show it.
 *
 * So this relays what a painter emits through the real encoder, the real
 * routing predicate and the real decoder, and gives it to both of them the way
 * a server would: the author included, since a client applies its own work
 * only when it comes back sequenced.
