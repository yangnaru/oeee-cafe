/**
 * Client-side canonical canvas history for the shared-layer collaboration
 * model.
 *
 * All clients receive the same server-sequenced message stream and fold it
 * into this history, so marking strokes undone and replaying from a savepoint
 * is deterministic across every participant:
 *
 * - Confirmed messages append to `entries`; periodic savepoints (layer copies
 *   plus per-user stroke state) bound the cost of replays.
 * - Local messages are applied optimistically and queued in the fork until
 *   the server echoes them back in canonical order. A remote message that
 *   doesn't touch any fork entry's affected area applies directly; one that
 *   overlaps triggers a replay of history with the fork re-applied on top.
 * - UNDO_POINT messages delimit strokes; UNDO/redo marks a user's entries and
 *   replays. Undo takes effect on server echo (like Drawpile), keeping every
 *   client's marking order identical.
 * - RESET_POINT (sent after a server session reset) squashes everything at or
 *   below the reset's base sequence into a new base savepoint.
