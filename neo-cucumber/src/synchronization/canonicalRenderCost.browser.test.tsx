/**
 * What a message from the canonical stream costs the rest of the painter.
 *
 * A room where three people are drawing delivers something like eighty
 * canonical messages a second, and every one of them lands on this component
 * before it reaches a canvas. The history reports its undo/redo flags after
 * each one, and for a while that report was a fresh object -- so React
 * re-rendered the whole painter, both toolbox columns and every button in
 * them, eighty times a second, on the same thread that was meant to be
 * following somebody's pen. The flags themselves move a handful of times in a
 * session.
 *
 * So this counts commits rather than measuring time: the cost being guarded
 * against is React's, and a burst of remote marks that changes nothing about
 * what the local user can undo must not reach React at all.
