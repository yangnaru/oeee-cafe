/**
 * The replay viewer's own catalogs.
 *
 * Its labels are messages like every other string in this package -- extracted
 * by the same command, translated in the same format, reviewed in the same
 * place -- but they are compiled into a catalog of their own rather than the
 * package's.
 *
 * That is not tidiness, it is weight. The viewer ships as a standalone script
 * on every post page, and the package catalog carries the toolbox, the modals
 * and everything else -- sixty-odd messages to render seven labels. Its own
 * catalog holds seven, which is most of the difference between a 61kB viewer
 * and a 36kB one.
